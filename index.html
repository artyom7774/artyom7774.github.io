                <h2 align="center">History</h2>
                <p align="center">The astronauts were looking for a new planet, as the Earth had become uninhabitable. They have been exploring space for a very long time. Fuel and food were supposed to run out in 30 days, and there were no new planets on the radar... Suddenly they discovered that 100,000 km from the ship there is a Planet similar to Earth. Since they might not have enough fuel and food to travel further into space, they decided to explore the Planet - in the hope that they would no longer have to surf through space. The astronauts set a landmark on this planet, and they had to wait 25 days to get to this planet, and during that time they did not even prepare for the fact that dangerous creatures could inhabit the Planet. When they reached the Planet and overcame the atmosphere, a shell hit their ship, and the ship began to fall. The astronauts had to eject in order not to crash. The ship crashed somewhere on an unknown planet, and the astronauts landed in full force on an unknown planet. Now their main task will not be to explore the Planet, but to search for a ship, since the Planet turned out to be inhabited by aggressive creatures. Since the ship has little fuel left, it is necessary to find a fuel replacement or synthesize it from alien resources. Also, a part flew away from the ship, without which the ship will not take off - it needs to be found. And, of course, we need to find the ship itself. And only when the team finds the ship, repairs it and leaves this planet, the game will be considered completed… In the meantime, you will have an exciting journey through an unknown planet, collecting resources, searching for a ship, fighting with aliens and much more. In the game you will learn how to work in a team, help each other, you can also think about how best to act in difficult situations, how to manage your resources and much more. Remember, when we are united, we are invincible.</p>
